Ray-Casting Maze Exploration Project

Welcome to the Ray-Casting Maze Exploration Project! ðŸŽ®
Introduction

This project draws inspiration from the iconic Wolfenstein 3D game, which pioneered the first-person shooter (FPS) genre. Through this project, you'll embark on a journey into the realm of ray-casting, a fundamental technique used in rendering 3D environments in real-time.
Project Goal

Your goal is to create a dynamic first-person view inside a maze, where you'll navigate through corridors and chambers, seeking a way out. Using ray-casting techniques, you'll simulate the perception of depth and distance, allowing the player to explore the maze from a first-person perspective.
Why Ray-Casting?

Ray-casting provides a simplified yet effective method for rendering 3D environments in real-time, making it suitable for resource-constrained systems and early video game development. By mastering ray-casting, you'll gain insights into the fundamental principles of 3D graphics rendering and enhance your programming skills.
Key Features

    Dynamic View: Experience a real-time first-person view of the maze environment.
    Ray-Casting Rendering: Simulate the projection of rays to render walls, floors, and ceilings with depth perception.
    Player Interaction: Enable player movement and interaction within the maze environment.
    Navigation: Implement algorithms for maze generation and pathfinding to create challenging and immersive gameplay.
